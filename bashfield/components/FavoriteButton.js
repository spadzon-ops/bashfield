The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failed due to a syntax error in the file `/pages/listing/[id].js`.

The specific error is an "Unterminated regexp literal."

### Solution
1. In the file `/pages/listing/[id].js` at line 582, check for an unterminated regular expression literal.
2. Correct the regular expression to ensure it is properly terminated to fix the syntax error.

It's also suggested to run `npm run build` locally to identify and correct any issues with the regular expression error.
